Using Angular BootStrap for apply angular Framwork on DOM event i.e. on click event of button

Like Following way

        var cmdButton = document.querySelector("#cmdButton");
        cmdButton.addEventListener('click', function () {
            angular.bootstrap(document, ['sample']);
        })

controller as

How:

.directive('gRendering', function () {
        return {
            restrict: 'E',
            template: '<span>One of Employee name is {{gdata.sample}}</span>',
            controller: function () {
                this.sample="pratik"
            },
            controllerAs:'gdata'

        }
    });
	
Advantage:

Using the "controller as" syntax allows you to directly reference the controller object within the
template. By doing this, you are able to assign attributes to the controller object itself rather
than to $scope.

You get more information in the view. By using this syntax, you are able to directly
infer the source of the object from only the template, which is something you could
not do before.

You are able to define directive controllers anonymously and define them where you
choose. Being able to rebrand a function object in a directive allows a lot of flexibility
in the application structure and locality of definition.	

	//Define Handler
	var unbind = $rootScope.$on('busEvent', function() {
		$log.log('Handler called!');
	});
	
	//This handler will gone when controller is going to destroy
	$scope.$on('$destroy', unbind);


Cusom Event in Angular

There is 4 approch to Custom Event

1. using $rootScope.$broadCast()
2. using $rootScope.$emit() 
	Note:you also need to clean this listner by using $digest Event
3.Event bus as a service.
	Create a service for Raise/Catch Event 
4.Event bus as a decorator
